Pactum-AI 🤝
============

**AI-powered contract analysis and risk intelligence system**

📌 Overview
-----------

**Pactum-AI** is an AI-driven system designed to analyze legal contracts, identify potential risks, extract critical clauses, and provide structured insights to assist decision-making.

The project focuses on applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **LLM-based reasoning** to automate one of the most time-consuming tasks in legal and business workflows: **contract review**.

🚀 Key Features
---------------

*   📄 **Contract ingestion** – Upload and process raw contract text
    
*   🧠 **Clause extraction** – Identify and classify key legal clauses
    
*   ⚠️ **Risk flagging** – Highlight potentially risky or ambiguous clauses
    
*   🏷️ **Structured outputs** – Convert unstructured legal text into usable data
    
*   🔍 **Semantic understanding** – Context-aware analysis instead of keyword matching
    

🧠 How It Works (High-Level)
----------------------------

1.  Contract text is preprocessed and cleaned
    
2.  NLP pipelines extract clause boundaries and semantic meaning
    
3.  LLM-based reasoning analyzes obligations, liabilities, and risks
    
4.  Results are returned in a structured, readable format
    

This approach prioritizes **contextual understanding** over rule-based heuristics.

🛠️ Tech Stack
--------------

*   **Python**
    
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
    
*   **Prompt engineering**
    
*   **Text preprocessing & parsing**
    

_(Model/API layer can be swapped depending on deployment requirements.)_

🎯 Use Cases
------------

*   Legal teams reviewing large volumes of contracts
    
*   Startups analyzing vendor or partnership agreements
    
*   Compliance checks for obligations and liabilities
    
*   Educational exploration of AI in legal-tech
    

📈 Current Status
-----------------

*   Core contract analysis logic implemented
    
*   Clause extraction and risk reasoning functional
    
*   Prototype stage (not production-hardened)
    

🧪 Limitations
--------------

*   Not a substitute for licensed legal advice
    
*   Accuracy depends on model quality and prompt design
    
*   Complex jurisdiction-specific clauses may require fine-tuning
    

🔮 Future Improvements
----------------------

*   Contract comparison and version diffing
    
*   Confidence scoring for extracted clauses
    
*   Web-based UI for uploads and visualization
    
*   Fine-tuned domain-specific language models
    
*   Audit logs and explainability layer
